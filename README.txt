Adding people:
    ex: 0;Example Name0;example_picture.jpg;s
    ID Number = 0, Name = ExampleName0, Name of Picture = example_picture.jpg, Student/Mentor = s
    NOTE: Times are kept track using names as a key, so identical names are bad!

Adding Pictures:
    Put the picture in data/profilepics. If the picture does not exist or
    the path is left blank, the default.jpg image will be used instead.

Hours for a person are recorded whenever the person logs out
